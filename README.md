# Coursera IBM Data Science Professional Capstone

This repository contains the Capstone I worked on during the IBM Professional Data Science Course.

The Capstone involved analysis of neighborhood data from any country/state and using K-Means clustering to group similar neighborhoods together.

My project was to analyse neighborhoods of Australia and try to cluster related neighborhoods together. 
Neighborhoods belonging to the same cluster can be analysed using their most common venues in order to take important 
decisions such as; 
Which neighborhood is better to open up a restaurant? 
Which neighborhoods prefer cafe's and cinemas or even nightclubs?
This will help any business to decide where they want to set up shop as they will know which neighborhood will prefer their business. 
It can also help to analyse if any particular type of business is not present in a given neighborhood like a neighborhood has only restaurants and cafes but no 
night clubs then somebody who owns a chain of nightclubs can set one up there.

The .pdf file has the report about this project.
The .ipynb file contains the code for this analysis.
